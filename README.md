## üåü **Key Features**
1. **Fractional Ownership**: Securely buy and sell fractions of high-value properties using blockchain technology.  
2. **Real-Time Price Predictions**: Machine learning models predict property prices based on historical and market data.  
3. **Smart Contracts**: Automated ownership transfers and transactions using Ethereum-based ERC-721 tokens.  
4. **Decentralized Marketplace**: Trade tokenized real estate assets in a secure, transparent environment.  
5. **Wallet Integration**: Securely manage transactions using MetaMask.  
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for a seamless experience, built with React.js.

## üîß **Technology Stack**
### **Blockchain**  
- **Ethereum Blockchain**: Decentralized platform for secure token transactions.  
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity for ERC-721 tokens.  
- **ethers.js**: Simplified interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.  
- **Hardhat**: For testing and deploying smart contracts.  
- **OpenZeppelin**: Secure contract library for reliable implementation.  

### **Machine Learning**  
- **Models**: Random Forest for price predictions with 90% accuracy.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **scikit-learn**: Training and evaluating ML models.  
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
  - **Matplotlib**: Visualizing property trends and market data.  

### **Web Development**  
- **Frontend**: React.js for an interactive user interface.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests and business logic.  
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient and secure data storage.  
- **Flask**: Integration of machine learning models for seamless predictions.

## üöÄ **How It Works**
1. **Tokenization**:  
   - Enter property details, and the platform generates ERC-721 tokens representing fractional ownership.  
   - Smart contracts ensure secure and transparent transactions.  

2. **Price Prediction**:  
   - Input property features, and the ML model provides accurate real-time price forecasts.  

3. **Marketplace**:  
   - Users can trade tokenized properties in a decentralized, secure digital environment.  

4. **Wallet Integration**:  
   - Transactions are securely managed using MetaMask.  

---

## üìä **Statistics**
- **Prediction Accuracy**: 90% for property prices.  
- **Transaction Transparency**: 100% ensured via blockchain.  
- **Fractional Ownership**: Investments as low as 1% per property.
